Here is where you can find all of our open source quests.
Currently there are only 2 quests being developed - with one of them (Martian Invasion) having passed it's alpha stage whereas 'The Mystery of Aquae Sulis' is still uncompleted.
You can help by expanding this. Just follow the template outlined by 'Martian Invasion'.
And when in doubt, don't hesitate to contact me at ivanus@gqempire.gq.
